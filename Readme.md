# Path through a maze solver

Find the minimum number steps required to navigate a maze on a checkered field where some of the tiles are illegal. I was asked about this in a coding interview. This is my solution that I did after the interview when I had more time to make it look nice. The original problem was to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the finish. This version also finds and prints all of the shortest paths containing this minium number of steps.

### Prerequisites

This needs a recent C++ compiler, nothing more.
